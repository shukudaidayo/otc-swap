# ocarina.trade

Peer-to-peer OTC trades for NFTs and tokens. No backend, no accounts, no middleman.

**Live site:** [ocarina.trade](https://ocarina.trade)

## What it does

- **Create an offer** — Select the assets you want to trade (ERC-721, ERC-1155, whitelisted ERC-20, or ETH on the taker side), optionally restrict to a specific taker, and sign the order. A shareable link is generated.
- **View an offer** — Anyone with the link can see both sides of the trade, verify the assets on Etherscan, and check the order status (open, filled, cancelled, expired).
- **Accept an offer** — The eligible taker approves their assets and executes the atomic trade in a single transaction. Both sides exchange assets simultaneously — no escrow, no partial fills.

## How it works

All trade logic is handled by [Seaport](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport) (v1.6), OpenSea's audited, immutable, on-chain settlement protocol. Orders are signed off-chain (free, no gas) and settled atomically on-chain when accepted.

The only custom contract is **OTCZone** (~135 lines), which:
- Restricts who can fill an order (optional taker address)
- Enforces an ERC-20 whitelist (prevents impostor token scams)
- Emits events for order discovery (the offers page)

OTCZone never touches user funds. Assets stay in your wallet until the trade executes.

## Trust model

- **No backend** — all state is on-chain or in the URL. Nothing to maintain, no servers to trust.
- **No database** — order discovery is powered by on-chain events.
- **No escrow** — assets remain in your wallet until the atomic trade.
- **Audited settlement** — Seaport has been professionally audited and has processed billions in volume.
- **Open source** — fork it, verify it, run your own.
