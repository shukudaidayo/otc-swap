# OTC Swap - Technical Specification (Seaport Edition)

## 1. Overview

A peer-to-peer OTC swap website for trading NFTs (and whitelisted ERC-20s) directly between two parties. Uses OpenSea's **Seaport protocol** as the on-chain settlement layer, with a minimal custom **OTCZone** contract for taker restriction, ERC-20 whitelisting, and order discovery. No backend, no database, no accounts.

### Motivation

Both otc.sudoswap.xyz and opensea.io/deals are dead. The ecosystem needs a simple, durable OTC swap tool. This project prioritizes **longevity** and **minimal maintenance** over feature richness.

### Why Seaport

- **Near-zero custom contract surface.** The only custom contract (OTCZone, ~30 lines) handles taker restriction, ERC-20 whitelisting, and order discovery — it never touches user funds. Seaport handles all asset transfers.
- **Battle-tested security.** Multiple professional audits, billions in volume, years of production use.
- **No liability.** We are building a frontend, not a protocol. The smart contract layer is OpenSea's responsibility.
- **Free order creation.** Seaport uses off-chain signatures — creating an offer costs zero gas.
- **Richer features for free.** ERC-20 support, criteria-based offers, and multi-chain support come built-in.

### Design Principles

- **No backend**: All state lives on-chain or in the URL. Nothing to maintain, no servers to keep running.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Fewer deps = fewer things that break over time.
- **Anti-scam by default**: Token verification and warnings are first-class concerns, not afterthoughts.
- **Seaport SDK**: Use seaport-js for order construction, signing, and fulfillment. The SDK is tied to an immutable contract — it will work as long as Seaport 1.6 exists on-chain, regardless of whether OpenSea continues maintaining it.

---

## 2. V1 Scope

- **Chain**: Ethereum Mainnet (Sepolia for testing)
- **Token types**: ERC-721, ERC-1155, ERC-20 (whitelisted only), and native ETH
- **Swap structure**: Multi-asset <-> multi-asset (each side can have 1+ items)
- **Counterparty**: Optionally restricted to a specific address, or open to anyone
- **Expiration**: Required (default 30 days, configurable in UI)
- **Cross-chain**: Out of scope (Seaport is per-chain)

---

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Seaport Protocol

Seaport (v1.6) is deployed at a canonical address on Ethereum and all major EVM chains. We interact with it as a consumer — no deployment needed.

**Canonical addresses:**
- Seaport 1.6: `0x0000000000000068F116a894984e2DB1123eB395`
- Conduit Controller: `0x00000000F9490004C11Cef243f5400493c00Ad63`

#### Seaport Order Model

A Seaport order consists of:

```
OrderComponents {
  offerer         // Maker's address
  zone            // Optional restriction contract (address(0) for unrestricted)
  offer[]         // Items the maker is giving
  consideration[] // Items the maker wants + recipients
  orderType       // 0=FULL_OPEN, 1=PARTIAL_OPEN, 2=FULL_RESTRICTED, 3=PARTIAL_RESTRICTED
  startTime       // When the order becomes valid
  endTime         // When the order expires
  zoneHash        // Arbitrary data for zone validation
  salt            // Nonce for uniqueness
  conduitKey      // Which conduit to use for transfers (bytes32(0) for Seaport direct)
  counter         // Maker's current counter (for bulk cancellation)
}

OfferItem / ConsiderationItem {
  itemType        // 0=NATIVE, 1=ERC20, 2=ERC721, 3=ERC1155
  token           // Contract address
  identifierOrCriteria  // Token ID (or merkle root for criteria-based)
  startAmount     // Amount (1 for ERC-721)
  endAmount       // Amount (can differ from start for dutch auctions; same for fixed)
}
```

#### How Our Swaps Map to Seaport

For a simple NFT-for-NFT swap:

1. **Maker creates an order off-chain:**
   - `offer`: The NFTs/tokens the maker is giving
   - `consideration`: The NFTs/tokens the maker wants, with `recipient` set to the maker's address
   - `orderType`: `FULL_OPEN` (0) for open-to-anyone, or `FULL_RESTRICTED` (2) with a zone for taker restriction
   - `startTime`: now
   - `endTime`: expiration timestamp
   - `conduitKey`: `bytes32(0)` (use Seaport directly for transfers)

2. **Maker signs the order** using EIP-712 typed data signing (no gas).

3. **Maker shares a URL** containing the signed order.

4. **Taker opens the URL**, reviews the swap, approves their assets to Seaport, and calls `fulfillOrder()` — one on-chain transaction that atomically swaps all assets.

#### Taker Restriction

- **Open to anyone**: `orderType: FULL_RESTRICTED`, `zone: OTCZone address`, `zoneHash: bytes32(0)`. The zone still validates ERC-20 whitelist but allows any fulfiller.
- **Restricted taker**: `orderType: FULL_RESTRICTED`, `zone: OTCZone address`, `zoneHash: bytes32(takerAddress)`. The zone validates both the fulfiller address and the ERC-20 whitelist.

**Note:** All orders use `FULL_RESTRICTED` with the OTCZone so that ERC-20 whitelist enforcement always applies. Open-to-anyone orders simply set `zoneHash` to `bytes32(0)`.

The **OTCZone** is a minimal custom contract deployed once per chain. It combines three responsibilities: taker restriction, ERC-20 whitelist enforcement, and order registration.

Implementation: `contracts/src/OTCZone.sol`

The contract implements Seaport 1.6's `ZoneInterface` (from `seaport-types`). It has no owner, no mutable state, no admin functions, and no access to user funds. It serves three purposes:
1. **Taker validation**: Checks that the fulfiller matches the allowed taker in `zoneHash`.
2. **ERC-20 whitelist**: Rejects orders containing non-whitelisted ERC-20 tokens, both at registration and at fulfillment. Whitelist is set at deployment (immutable — no admin can modify it). Mainnet whitelist: WETH, USDC, USDT, USDS, EURC.
3. **Order registry**: Makers call `registerOrder` after signing to publish their order for discovery. The offers page queries `OrderRegistered` events.

ERC-20 enforcement happens at three layers:
- **Frontend**: The Create page only offers whitelisted ERC-20s (WETH, USDC, USDT, USDS, EURC).
- **Registration**: `registerOrder` reverts if the order contains a non-whitelisted ERC-20.
- **Fulfillment**: `validateOrder` reverts if Seaport tries to settle an order with a non-whitelisted ERC-20.

The `orderURI` field stores the base64-encoded signed order, so the frontend can reconstruct the swap page from the event alone.

**Note:** Seaport also allows the offerer to cancel by incrementing their counter (bulk cancel) or cancelling specific orders on-chain.

#### Approvals

Users approve the Seaport contract directly (or a conduit) to transfer their assets. Since we use `conduitKey: bytes32(0)`, approvals go directly to the Seaport contract address.

- ERC-721: `setApprovalForAll(seaportAddress, true)`
- ERC-1155: `setApprovalForAll(seaportAddress, true)`
- ERC-20: `approve(seaportAddress, amount)`

#### Key Differences from Custom Contract

| Aspect | Custom Contract | Seaport |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Order creation | On-chain tx (gas cost) | Off-chain signature (free) |
| Order data | Stored in tx events | Stored in OTCZone registry events |
| Cancel | On-chain tx per order | On-chain: per-order or bulk (increment counter) |
| Kill switch | Owner-only one-way kill | N/A — not our contract |
| Taker fill | approve + fillOrder | approve + fulfillOrder |
| ERC-20 support | Hardcoded whitelist | Whitelisted via OTCZone |
| Audit status | Unaudited | Extensively audited |

### 3.2 Frontend

#### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 19
- **Web3**: ethers.js v6
- **Wallet connection**: Reown AppKit (WalletConnect + injected providers)
- **Styling**: Minimal custom CSS. No CSS framework.
- **NFT metadata**: On-chain tokenURI + IPFS/HTTP resolution
- **Build**: Vite
- **Hosting**: Static site (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or IPFS)

#### Pages / Routes

Hash-based routing (works on static hosts, no server config needed).

1. **`#/`** - Home / landing page
   - Brief explanation of what the site does
   - "Create Swap" button

2. **`#/create`** - Create a new swap offer
   - Two columns: "You Send" and "You Receive"
   - Each column: add/remove assets (token address + token ID, or ERC-20 amount)
   - Optional: taker address field (with ENS resolution)
   - Expiration (default 30 days)
   - Asset preview with NFT metadata and verification status
   - Click "Create Swap" → approve assets → sign EIP-712 order → register on-chain → generate shareable link

3. **`#/swap/{chainId}/{txHash}`** - View and accept a swap
   - Fetch `OrderRegistered` event from the registration tx receipt
   - Extract signed order from `orderURI` field
   - Display both sides with NFT previews and verification warnings
   - Validate order on-chain via Seaport `getOrderStatus` (check if filled/cancelled)
   - If valid and user is eligible: approval flow + "Accept Swap" button
   - If user is maker: "Cancel" button
   - Anti-scam education banner (non-dismissable)

4. **`#/offers`** - Browse offers
   - "My Offers" tab (default): orders involving connected wallet
   - "All Open" tab: paginated, all open orders
   - "Completed" tab: filled orders
   - Populated by querying `OrderRegistered` events from OTCZone, cross-referenced with Seaport for order status (filled/cancelled)

#### URL Encoding

Since the signed order is stored on-chain in the `OrderRegistered` event, the URL only needs the chain ID and the registration transaction hash:

```
#/swap/{chainId}/{txHash}
```

Example: `#/swap/1/0x7bd391346f238fc36c19291a1f9678773ca5a47a475814592194802cbec983cb`

The swap page fetches the tx receipt, parses the `OrderRegistered` event to extract the full signed order, and has everything needed to display the swap and call `fulfillOrder`. This is the same pattern used in the current implementation — short, clean URLs with on-chain data retrieval.

#### Order Discovery / Offers Page

The OTCZone contract emits `OrderRegistered` events when makers publish their orders. The offers page queries these events (with the same chunked block-range approach used currently) and cross-references with Seaport's `getOrderStatus` to determine which orders are still open, filled, or cancelled.

- **My Offers**: Filter `OrderRegistered` events where `maker` or `taker` matches the connected wallet.
- **All Open**: All `OrderRegistered` events, filtered client-side to exclude filled/cancelled/expired orders. Paginated.
- **Completed**: Cross-reference with Seaport `OrderFulfilled` events.

Each `OrderRegistered` event contains the `orderURI`, which has everything needed to reconstruct the swap page link.

## 4. Seaport Integration Details

All Seaport interactions use the **seaport-js SDK**, which handles order construction, EIP-712 signing, hash computation, and fulfillment parameter generation.

### 4.1 Creating an Order

```js
import { Seaport } from '@opensea/seaport-js'

const seaport = new Seaport(signer)

const { executeAllActions } = await seaport.createOrder({
  zone: OTC_ZONE_ADDRESS,
  zoneHash: takerAddress ? ethers.zeroPadValue(takerAddress, 32) : ethers.ZeroHash,
  offer: [
    { itemType: 2, token: nftAddress, identifier: tokenId },  // ERC-721
  ],
  consideration: [
    { itemType: 2, token: wantedNftAddress, identifier: wantedTokenId, recipient: makerAddress },
  ],
  orderType: 2,  // FULL_RESTRICTED (always, for zone validation)
  endTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60,
})

const order = await executeAllActions()  // Signs the order (no gas)
```

### 4.2 Fulfilling an Order

```js
const { executeAllActions } = await seaport.fulfillOrder({ order })
const tx = await executeAllActions()  // On-chain tx
```

### 4.3 Cancelling an Order

```js
const tx = await seaport.cancelOrders([order.parameters])
```

For bulk cancellation (invalidate all open orders): `seaport.incrementCounter()`.

### 4.4 Checking Order Status

```js
const orderHash = seaport.getOrderHash(order.parameters)
const { isCancelled, totalFilled, totalSize } = await seaport.getOrderStatus(orderHash)
```

- `totalFilled === totalSize` → fully filled
- `isCancelled` → cancelled
- Neither → still open (check `endTime` client-side for expiration)

## 5. Anti-Scam Measures

Unchanged from original spec. See sections 4.1-4.3 of the original SPEC.md.

Key points:
- Verified token list (bundled + remote GitHub fetch)
- Verified / Unverified / Suspicious indicators per token
- Impostor detection (same name, different address)
- Full contract addresses always visible, linked to Etherscan
- Non-dismissable education banner on swap page
- ERC-20 whitelist enforced at three layers (frontend, registration, fulfillment) — prevents impostor token scams

---

## 6. NFT Metadata Resolution

Unchanged from original spec. See section 5 of the original SPEC.md.

- On-chain tokenURI/uri call → IPFS/HTTP/data URI resolution
- sessionStorage cache

---

## 7. User Flow

### Creating a Swap

1. User connects wallet
2. Navigates to Create page
3. Adds assets they want to send (contract address + token ID, or ERC-20 amount)
4. Adds assets they want to receive
5. Optionally sets taker address and expiration
6. Clicks "Create Swap"
7. UI checks and requests approvals for maker's assets to Seaport (gas, per collection)
8. UI constructs Seaport order and prompts EIP-712 signature (**no gas**)
9. UI calls `registerOrder` on OTCZone to publish the order for discovery (gas, cheap)
10. UI generates shareable link containing the signed order
11. User copies link and sends to counterparty

### Accepting a Swap

1. Counterparty opens the shared link
2. UI fetches `OrderRegistered` event from the registration tx receipt and extracts the signed order
3. UI validates: checks Seaport for order status, checks expiration, verifies signature
4. UI displays all assets with verification indicators
5. Counterparty reviews the trade
6. Connects wallet
7. UI checks and requests approvals for taker's assets to Seaport
8. Clicks "Accept Swap"
9. UI calls `fulfillOrder` — one transaction, atomic swap
10. Assets are exchanged

### Cancelling a Swap

1. Maker opens the swap link (or navigates from My Offers)
2. Clicks "Cancel"
3. UI calls `seaport.cancel([orderComponents])` — one on-chain tx
4. Order is cancelled on-chain

---

## 8. Future Roadmap

### V1.1 - Additional EVM Chains
- Seaport is already deployed on Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, etc.
- Add chain selector to the UI
- Chain ID is embedded in the EIP-712 domain, so orders are inherently chain-specific
- Deploy OTCZone per chain (same constructor args, trivial deployment)
- Update constants with chain-specific RPCs, OTCZone addresses, and verified token lists

### V1.2 - Criteria-Based Offers
- Seaport natively supports criteria-based offers (e.g., "any Bored Ape")
- Use merkle trees of token IDs, or wildcard (criteria = 0 for any token in collection)
- UI: "I'll trade my X for any token from collection Y"

### V2 - Solana Support
- Separate program, shared UI
- Not related to Seaport

### Not Planned
- Order book / listing marketplace
- Chat / messaging
- Mobile app (responsive web is sufficient)
- Cross-chain swaps (fundamentally different mechanism)

---

## 9. Forkability & Continuity

### License
MIT.

### No Contract Dependency
Seaport is permissionless and immutable — it cannot be shut down or upgraded out from under us. Anyone can build a frontend that talks to it.

### Frontend Configurability
All environment-specific values in `src/lib/constants.js`:
- Seaport contract address (canonical, same on all chains)
- OTCZone contract address per chain
- OTCZone deploy block per chain (for efficient event queries)
- ERC-20 whitelist addresses per chain
- RPC endpoint URLs per chain
- Verified token list remote URL
- IPFS gateway URL

### No Proprietary Services
Zero accounts, API keys, or proprietary services required:
- NFT metadata: on-chain tokenURI + public IPFS gateways
- Blockchain data: public RPC endpoints
- Hosting: any static file host
- Verified token list: static JSON file

---

## 10. Dependencies (Exhaustive List)

### Runtime
- **ethers** (v6): Contract interaction, ABI encoding
- **@opensea/seaport-js**: Order construction, EIP-712 signing, fulfillment
- **react** + **react-dom** (v19): UI rendering
- **react-router** (v7): Hash-based routing
- **@reown/appkit** + **@reown/appkit-adapter-ethers**: Wallet connection

### Dev
- **vite**: Build tool
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: JSX transform
- **foundry** (forge): OTCZone contract development and testing

The only custom contract is the OTCZone (~30 lines), deployed once per chain. Foundry is needed only for this contract.

---

## 11. Open Questions

1. ~~**URL length**~~: **Resolved** — URLs use the `#/swap/{chainId}/{txHash}` format, same as the current implementation. The signed order is stored on-chain in the `OrderRegistered` event and fetched via tx receipt.

2. ~~**Offers page without events**~~: **Resolved** — the OTCZone contract emits `OrderRegistered` events, providing an on-chain index of published orders. The offers page queries these events and cross-references with Seaport for order status.

3. ~~**OTCZone implementation**~~: **Resolved** — implemented and tested. The Seaport 1.6 `ZoneInterface` requires `authorizeOrder`, `validateOrder`, `getSeaportMetadata`, and `supportsInterface`. Our contract implements all four. See `contracts/src/OTCZone.sol` and `contracts/test/OTCZone.t.sol`.

4. ~~**Maker approvals timing**~~: **Resolved** — prompt approvals at order creation. The maker pays gas for approvals, but the order is immediately fillable. This avoids confusion where a taker opens a link and can't fill because the maker forgot to approve.
